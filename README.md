An iOS client for the [Nextcloud Passwords](https://git.mdns.eu/nextcloud/passwords) app. Available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1546212226).

This app allows you to view, create, edit and delete entries on your Nextcloud server. It offers a variety of filtering and sorting options. End-to-end/client-side encryption and encrypted offline storage make sure your data is secure.

A Password AutoFill provider is integrated into the app for seamless login experiences. You can enable this feature in iOS's Settings app.

This app requires a Nextcloud server with the Passwords app installed.
