A client for the Nextcloud Passwords app.

This app allows you to view, create, edit and delete entries on your Nextcloud server. It offers a variety of filtering and sorting options. End-to-end/client-side encryption and encrypted offline storage make sure your data is secure.

A Password AutoFill provider is integrated into the app for seamless login experiences. You can enable this feature in iOS's Settings app.
